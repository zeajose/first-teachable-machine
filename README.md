It was train with MobileNet to do image classification in the browser and uses transfer learning, which bootstraps our training with the pre-trained MobileNet model and customizes it to train for your application.


## How to use it?

- Go to https://first-teachable-machine.herokuapp.com/
- OR copy the repository and open index.html in a Web Browser 
- Allow webcam
- Show 3-types of objects for training
- After a few examples your machine will be ready to classify the objects :)
